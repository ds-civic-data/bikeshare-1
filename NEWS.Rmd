# News

### 1.20

* Addressed errors arising from new columns types introduced in the new NABSA GBFS guidelines.  
* Added the `output` argument, allowing users to either save the outputs as `.Rds` files or return them as list or dataframe objects. As a result, the directory argument is no longer required if `output = "return"`
* Minor bug fixes and documentation improvements

### 1.10

* Thanks to Mark Padgham (@mpadge), we've introduced a new function `get_gbfs_cities` that lists all of the cities currently releasing feeds! This function will help inform users who do not have a specific city already in mind.  
* Add functionality for new column types introduced in the new NABSA GBFS guidelines.  
* Minor bug fixes (unused imports, vignette errors, etc.)
