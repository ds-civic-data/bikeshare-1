\title{Grab the free_bike_status feed.}
\usage{
get_free_bike_status(
  city,
  directory = NULL,
  file = "free_bike_status.rds",
  output = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{city}{A character string or a url to an active gbfs.json feed. See \code{get_gbfs_cities}
for a current list of available cities.}

\item{directory}{The name of an existing folder or folder to be created, where the feed will
will be saved. This argument is only required if `output = "save"` (the default option.)
If `output = "return"`, this argument will be ignored.}

\item{file}{Name of an existing file or a new file to be saved. Must end in .rds.
This argument will be ignored if `output = "return"`.}

\item{output}{The type of output method. If `output = "save"`, the object will be saved as
an .rds object at the given path. If `output = "return"`, the output will be returned
as a dataframe object. Setting `output = "both"` will do both.}
}
\value{
The output of the function depends on argument to `output`: Either a 
saved .rds object generated from the current station_information feed, a 
dataframe object, or both.
}
\description{
If the specified file does not exist, \code{get_free_bike_status} saves the free_bike_status
feed for a given city as a .rds object. If the specified file does exist, \code{get_free_bike_status}
appends the current free_bike_status feed to the existing file. The resulting dataframe can
alternatively be returned (rather than saved) using the `output` argument. Go to 
`https://github.com/NABSA/gbfs/blob/master/gbfs.md` to see metadata for this dataset.

\examples{
# we can grab the free bike status feed for portland, 
# oregon in one of several ways! first, supply the `city` 
# argument as a URL, and save to file by leaving output 
# set to it's default. usually, we would supply a character 
# string (like "pdx", maybe,) for the `directory` argument 
# instead of `tempdir`.
\donttest{get_free_bike_status(city = "http://biketownpdx.socialbicycles.com/opendata/free_bike_status.json",  
                     directory = tempdir())}
                    
# or, instead, just supply the name of 
# the city as a string. 
\donttest{get_free_bike_status(city = "portland",
                     directory = tempdir())}
                    
# instead of saving the output as a file, we can 
# just return the output as a dataframe
\donttest{get_free_bike_status(city = "portland",  
                     output = "return")}
